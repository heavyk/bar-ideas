### act 1 analysis

in this scene you see john and louise together in a boat (though not very treecherous waters). john thinks that *all* women are gold diggers, and so he's scared that his wife is just out to cash in on his mother's inheritance. so, what he does to foil his wife's greed is to suicide himself with his own beliefs: which is that his wife won't get any of the inheritance if he's not alive anymore (and so therefore does not have any immediate relation to his mother anymore).

he dies, and she behaves as predicted, disposing of the body and embarking on a journey to go and try to win his mother's love over in order to get the inheritance. I get the sense (though I don't remember exact dialouge which would say otherwise) that he never really won over the affections of his mother either. the woman that plays his mother in the next act is quite an unlikeable woman, not really showing much affection for her other two sons either (richard and billy).

there are hints given that jonn's mother's castle is haunted by his sister kathleen, which will likely be executor of john's desire (to keep his perceived greedy wife away from his inheritance).
