- john
  - seemingly doesn't like his wife louise
  - kills himself (essentially) out on a boat, so louise won't get inheritance
- kane
  - kisses richard when she sees him
  - (necklace)
  - (came from new york)
- richard
  - makes statues
  - married to kane?
- kathleen (john's sister)
  - mother was 40 when giving birth to her
  - was like a "gift": an apple for the starving, and a gift for me
  - had a poem:
    - three sons, each who would marry and go away
    - but little kathleen, would always stay [in the castle?]
  - drowned in the pond
  - dead for 7 years
  - quite possibly a reference to (or foil of) "[countess cathleen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Countess_Cathleen)" by william butler yeats
    - a woman that sold her soul to the devil to save others from starvation. when she dies, it's determined that her intentions were altrusistic, and so therefore she ascends to heaven.
    - seems/feels similar in effort to [francis king](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_X._King) (though I haven't seen the ritual yet, I know there is one they perform for kathleen)
      - lots of golden order, oto, and isis-urania (mary wroth reference: countess of urania)
        - mary wroth was the dedication of ben jonson's play "the alchemist" -- promoting and encouraging female authorship of new realities (like shakespere did).
      - [florence farr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence_Farr)
      - keep in mind that francis king is the opposite to queen elizabeth/diana/venus, (ignoring subtle, because he's subtle)
      - [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olivia_Shakespear): According to Kline, Yeats compared Olivia [Shakespear] to Diana and Maud [Gonne] to Helen; he was attracted to dark coloured women, describing Olivia's skin as "a little darker than a Greek's would have been and her hair was very dark".[16] Literary scholar Humphrey Carpenter writes that Yeats' impression of Olivia was one of a woman with "a profound culture, a knowledge of French, English, and Italian and seemed always at leisure. Her nature was gentle and contemplative, and she was content, it seems, to have no more of life than leisure and the talk of her friends"
      - yeats had two muses: one is maud/helen and the other olivia/diana. the difference between helen and diana as a muse is as different as aphrodite is to ereshkigal.
- billy (richard's brother) - (bart, in real life married to kane)
  - comes to get kain because richard is busy making statues
  - has an older brother (john -- another one?)
    - his wife (louise) is also from america
  - seems a bit miffed about richard making out with kain when he brings her to the castle
  - wants to get married
  - is determined to get married to "cain" (kain)
- louise
  - married to john
  - reminds me of superman's girlfriend/wife
- lady halerin
  - thinks that only immediate family should give their thoughts to kathleen
    - kain can stay as long as she respects the "privacy of our personal duties"
    - referring to the ceremony for kathleen, where louise will find something else to do with her time
  - doesn't care for kain

### notable things
- jehn had a sister (kathleen?) that drowned

### castle halerin
- castle is haunted by kathleen
- (kain?) talks to (billy?) in the castle (learning about the haunted castle) before flying to ireland, where the castle is, I presume.
- billy tells kain that the castle is haunted also again in the car on the way from the airport.

### act 1 analysis

in this scene you see john and louise together in a boat (though not very treecherous waters). john thinks that *all* women are gold diggers, and so he's scared that his wife is just out to cash in on his mother's inheritance. so, what he does to foil his wife's greed is to suicide himself with his own beliefs: which is that his wife won't get any of the inheritance if he's not alive anymore (and so therefore does not have any immediate relation to his mother anymore).

he dies, and she behaves as predicted, disposing of the body and embarking on a journey to go and try to win his mother's love over in order to get the inheritance. I get the sense (though I don't remember exact dialouge which would say otherwise) that he never really won over the affections of his mother either. the woman that plays his mother in the next act is quite an unlikeable woman, not really showing much affection for her other two sons either (richard and billy).

there are hints given that jonn's mother's castle is haunted by his sister kathleen, which will likely be executor of john's desire (to keep his perceived greedy wife away from his inheritance).
